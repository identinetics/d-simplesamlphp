= Configure SSP as an SAML2 SP

== Create a default configuration:

    dscripts/run.sh -ir /init_config_ssp.sh
    dscripts/run.sh -ir /init_config_d7.sh


== Collect essential configuraton data to get started in a federation:

[width="100%"]
|===
|Item|Example values in default configuration
|<SP root URL> | https://sp.example.org/
|<SP entityID> | https://sp.example.org/simplesaml
|<Federation metadata URL> | http://mdfeed.federation.org/metadata.xml
|<Metadata signing cert> | metadata_crt.pem
|<Attributemap>| | federation specific mapping between "friendly names" and URN/OID
|===


== Load Balancer/Revese Proxy

This ist extermal to this docker image. Configure a reverse proxy (load balancer) terminating TLS to relay
  requests on the dockernet interface providing the HTTP_X_FORWARDED headers


== Virtual Host

Configure apache vhost (minimum: set ServerName to the <SP root URL> in sites-available/000-default.conf)

== Export SP Metadata to the Federation

Create the metadata for the SP and make it available to the IDPs.
Download the XML file from https://<sp-fqdn>/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/metadata.php/default-sp
Metadata created by SSP is minimal any might be compliant with the federation requirements and have to be edited.
Import into the federation's metadata aggregator (or the IDP for a local installation).

== Import the Federation Metadata
Configure cron & metarefresh accoring to https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-automated_metadata.
Key points are:
- Set 'src' in config-metarefresh.php to <Federation metadata URL>
- Set 'expireAfter accordingly
- Copy the <Metadata signing cert> from a trusted source (formally confirmed key exchange for
  production env - this is the trust anchor!)

== Configure the SP
- authsources.php:
[width="100%"]
|===
|Key | Value |
|entityID | <SP entityID>
|idp | null | leaving this null will trigger the idp discovery and allow more than one IDP to be used
|discoURL | null | The build-in disco service provides better UI control, but cookies are not shared across SPs
|===
- config.php
[width="100%"]
|===
|Key|Value|
|baseurlpath | https://sp.example.org/simplesaml | Full URL required for reverse proxy config
|technicalcontact_email | admin@example.org |
|technicalcontact_name | Support example.org |
|secretsalt | $(openssl rand -base64 30) |
|auth.adminpassword| ... | see timezone
|authproc.sp | 10 => array('class' => 'core:AttributeMap', 'pvp2name'), | add a custom or provided <Attributemap> to authproc.sp
|session.duration | 1*(60*60) | federation or deployment-specific value, e.g. 1h
|timezone | Europe/Vienna | http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
|===
- Configure the session store (config.php/store.type). Select 'sql' if the app uses phpsession.
  You may use the application database instead of sqllite3 (for drupal see https://www.drupal.org/node/1538334)
- module-cron.php
  Set the value of 'key' to a chosen secret.

== Outbound SMTP for Admin Alerts
Optionally configure postfix to forward mail from root to an accout on a smart host (/etc/postfix
is mapped to the docker host)

== Run

    dscripts/run.sh

To access the SSP admin page from the host server try:

    https://<sp-fqdn>/simplesaml

    username: admin
    password: <whateveryoudefinedbeforeanddeemedsecureenough>

    Go to the "Cron module information page" on the configuration tab, start the hourly cron job
    and check that the metadata refresh was completed with success (check logfile and that
    metadata/metarefresh-federation/ must not be empty). You may also use the "refresh metadata"
    link on the "Federation" tab.
    If metadata is consumed properly, then install the command into crontab as suggested.

To access SP pages try:
    https://<sp-fqdn>/test/test.php   # unauthenticated
    https://<sp-fqdn>/test/hellosaml.php   # authenticated

== Session Handling
-> If application is using SSP phpsession avoid the phpsession setting, use DB or memcached instead.
   (Option: Extend SP phpsession in application if you know what you are doing)

== Troubleshooting

1. Look up apache logs (/var/log/apache2/) for PHP exceptions
2. Turn up the debug level (INFO or DEBUG) and observe var/log/simplesaml/simplesamlphp.log
3. Use the SAML tracer add-on in Firefox to watch protocaol exchanges on HTTP and SAML levels


== Productionalization
Before or when moving the configuration to a production environment check the security-relevant settings,
such as secret, <Metadata signing cert>, auth.adminpassword etc.
